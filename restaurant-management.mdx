# Restaurant Management

ServeStream integrates with Square to streamline restaurant operations. Below are the steps to add a workflow and sync menus.

## Adding a Workflow

1. Navigate to **Restaurant Management** in the ServeStream dashboard.
2. Click **Add Workflow** to initiate a new workflow setup.
3. Select **Square** as the integration provider from the available options.
4. Click **Save Integration** to establish a connection between ServeStream and Square.
5. The system will create a Square integration block within the interface.

## Square Integration Process

- After saving, ServeStream will request necessary permissions to connect with Square.
- Once the permissions are granted, the system updates the status to **Active**.
- The integration allows syncing of menu items directly from the Square dashboard to ServeStream.
