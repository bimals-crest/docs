## AI Chat & Voice Agents

ServeStream includes the following calling options:

- **Incoming Calls**: Customers dial a dedicated phone number to interact with the AI assistant.
- **Invoked Calls**: The system automatically places a call to the customer when required.

## Example Call Flow for Takeout Orders

1. A customer calls the restaurant’s AI-powered phone line.
2. The AI assistant greets them and presents options:
   - **Make a Reservation**
   - **Place a Takeout Order**
   - **Speak to a Human Operator**
3. The AI assistant asks for essential details:
   - **Customer’s Name** for identification.
   - **Phone Number** for order confirmation.
   - **Menu Selection** (e.g., “Three non-veg biryanis”).
4. The AI confirms the order, including item details and total cost.
5. Once confirmed, the order is processed, and the customer receives a pickup confirmation.

## Additional Features

- The AI assistant can offer recommendations based on menu availability.
- Order history tracking for returning customers.
- Dynamic responses based on current restaurant conditions (e.g., busy hours, item availability).
