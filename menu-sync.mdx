## Syncing Menu from Square

4. Once synced, the updated menu items appear in ServeStreamâ€™s menu section.

## Editing and Managing Menu Items

1. Navigate to the **Menus** section under Restaurant Management.
2. Select the item you want to edit and click **Edit**.
3. Update details such as item name, price, category, or availability.
4. Save changes to reflect them in ServeStream and automatically sync with Square.
5. Deleted items in ServeStream will not remove them from Square, ensuring data consistency.

## Uploading an Image to Cloudflare R2 for Menu Items

To use images hosted on Cloudflare's R2 storage for your menu items, follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Cloudflare R2

- Sign up for a **Cloudflare account** if you don't already have one.
- Navigate to **R2** in the Cloudflare dashboard and create a new bucket.
- Choose a **name** for your bucket and select the appropriate region.

### 2. Upload an Image to Cloudflare R2

- Using the Cloudflare dashboard, go to your R2 bucket.
- Click **Upload** and select the image you wish to upload (e.g., a menu item image).
- After the image is uploaded, Cloudflare will generate a URL for the image. For example: https://<bucket-name>.<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com/<image-file-name>
- Copy this URL for use in the next steps.

### 3. Add the Image to a Menu Item in ServeStream

- In ServeStream, navigate to the **Menus** section.
- Select the menu item you want to add an image to.
- In the **Image URL** field, paste the Cloudflare R2 image URL you copied earlier.
- Save your changes.

The image will now be displayed as the menu item image in ServeStream.
